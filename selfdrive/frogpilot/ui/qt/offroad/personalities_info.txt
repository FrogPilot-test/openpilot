Following Distance:
Specifies the desired time gap, in seconds, that openpilot aims to maintain behind the lead vehicle. This parameter adjusts how closely your car follows the vehicle in front, ensuring a safe following distance that scales with your speed.

Real-World Example: If this value is set to 1.5 seconds and you're traveling at 50 mph (80 km/h), openpilot will strive to keep approximately 110 feet (33.5 meters) behind the car ahead.

Acceleration Change Sensitivity:
Controls the penalty applied for changes in acceleration, influencing how smoothly the car accelerates or decelerates. A higher value makes openpilot more reluctant to change acceleration abruptly, resulting in a smoother ride.

Real-World Example: With a higher value, openpilot will accelerate and decelerate more gradually, avoiding sudden jerks. A lower value allows for quicker acceleration and deceleration, which might feel less smooth.

Hazard Sensitivity:
Adjusts the penalty for getting too close to other vehicles or obstacles. A higher value makes openpilot more cautious when approaching other cars or obstacles, prioritizing safety by maintaining a safer distance.

Real-World Example: If there's a much slower car ahead, a higher value will cause openpilot to start braking sooner and more assertively, ensuring you don't approach the vehicle too quickly and maintain a safe buffer.

Speed Control Smoothness:
Controls the penalty on the rate of change of acceleration, promoting smoother transitions when changing speed.

Real-World Example: Increasing the value will make openpilot change speeds more gently when accelerating to match cruise speed or decelerating due to traffic, resulting in a smoother ride with fewer abrupt movements.

In Summary:

Following Distance: Sets the desired time gap to maintain behind the lead vehicle.
Acceleration Change Sensitivity: Controls how smoothly the car accelerates or decelerates by penalizing rapid changes in acceleration.
Hazard Sensitivity: Adjusts how cautious the car is when approaching other vehicles or obstacles by penalizing close proximity.
Speed Control Smoothness: Controls the smoothness of acceleration changes by penalizing high rates of change in acceleration (jerk).
